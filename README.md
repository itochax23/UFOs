# UFOs

## Overview
We have created a webpage using JavaScript, Bootstrap and HTML that allows for in-depth analysis of UFO sightings where users can filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, there are table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

* Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
* Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
